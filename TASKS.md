**✅ Completed Session 4 (October 30, 2025):**

### LOD Implementation
- [x] Created CelestialBodyLOD.ts class (345 lines)

  - Subdivisions: 4, 2, 0 (2,562 → 642 → 162 triangles)
  - Distance thresholds: 0, 50, 200 scene units
  - Automatic camera-based switching
  - Debug utilities (getCurrentLevel, getStats, logLODStats)

- [x] Updated ThreeSceneManager.tsx
  - Refactored renderSystem() to use CelestialBodyLOD
  - Planets use LOD (all detail levels)
  - Moons use LOD (parent-relative positioning maintained)
  - Removed unused imports (createPlanetObject, createMoonsForPlanet)
  - Animation loop already had LOD update logic

- [x] LOD distance constants (already in constants.ts)
  - HIGH: 0 units (subdivision 4)
  - MEDIUM: 50 units (subdivision 2)
  - LOW: 200 units (subdivision 0)

- [x] Build verification
  - TypeScript compilation: ✓ No errors
  - Vite build: ✓ Success (737.59 KB bundle)
  - All unused variables cleaned up

### Triangle Reduction Analysis
**Per Planet:**
- High detail: 2,562 triangles
- Medium detail: 642 triangles (75% reduction)
- Low detail: 162 triangles (94% reduction)

**Full System (8 planets + 20 moons):**
- All high: ~102,000 triangles
- Mixed LOD: ~35,000 triangles (66% reduction)
- All low: ~6,000 triangles (94% reduction)

### Manual Testing Required
See `LOD-TESTING-GUIDE.md` for complete testing procedures:
- [ ] Visual LOD switching verification (zoom in/out)
- [ ] Performance testing (60fps with full system)
- [ ] Draw call reduction measurement
- [ ] Object selection with LOD objects
- [ ] Memory leak testing (regeneration cycles)

**Note:** Automated browser testing unavailable in Docker environment. User must manually verify visual behavior and performance metrics.

## Session 4 Complete (October 30, 2025)

**Status:** ✅ M4 - LOD Optimization Implementation Complete
**Goal:** Implement 3-level LOD system for planets and moons

**Session Summary:**

- [x] Refactored ThreeSceneManager to use LOD
- [x] Fixed TypeScript compilation errors (unused imports/variables)
- [x] Verified build success (737.59 KB bundle)
- [x] Created LOD-TESTING-GUIDE.md for manual verification
- [x] Updated TASKS.md with M4 status

**Key Decisions:**
- Reused existing PlanetRenderer/MoonRenderer with subdivision parameter
- LOD thresholds: 0, 50, 200 units (already in constants.ts)
- Planet/moon systems grouped together (moons in planet local space)
- Animation loop already had LOD update logic (no changes needed)

**Triangle Reduction:** 66-94% depending on camera distance!

**Manual Testing Required:** See LOD-TESTING-GUIDE.md
